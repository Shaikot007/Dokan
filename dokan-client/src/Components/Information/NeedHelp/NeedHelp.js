        <p><strong>Question:</strong> What is your discounting policy?</p>
      </div>
      <div className="NeedHelpText">
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> We try to provide the best deals in Dhaka and many of our products are already
        discounted below the maximum retail price (MRP). We also offer discount codes under special circumstances,
        which are applied to the MRP. On any given product, we can only apply one type of discount. We always
        consider the best discount available to the customer. For example: If the MRP of a product is 100 taka
        and our list price is 92 taka -- the product is already sold at an 8% discount. This means that if the user
        applies a discount code for a 5% discount, we will still consider the best discount available to the user
        and sell the product at 92 taka.</p>
