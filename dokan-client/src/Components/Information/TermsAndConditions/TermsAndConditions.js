        not confirm acceptance of your offer to buy the product(s) ordered; that when we send the Order Confirmation
        E-mail and/or SMS a contract called an "agreement to sell" is concluded in accordance with Section 4(3) of
        the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 i.e. the transfer of the property in the goods is to take place at a future time
        when the product(s) is/are delivered to your designated address. We only accept your offer, and the above
        "agreement to sell" becomes a contract of sale for product(s) ordered by you in accordance with Section 4(4)
        of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, when the product(s) is/are delivered to your designated address and at that
        time the property in the goods is transferred from us to you.</p>
